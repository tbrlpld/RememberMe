TODO
----
* Add animations for card accept ~and reject.
* Add animations for welcome screen, transition to game view, build of game, build of card deck, destruction of card deck, destruction of game, transition to congratulations message, congratulations message itself.
* Prevent DOM maipulation for matching cards. Currently the matched class could be added to any card in the DOM. I have to think about this a little more. But, what I now realize is that the symbols are visible in the DOM.Not sure if I have to take cre of things like that to pass the class. It is not in the rubric.
* Make sure layout looks good on all screen sizes/devices. Large display (vertically) does not look too good right now. Footer is too far away from main. It should be more similar to the header.
* Update colors, especially of game area and header.
* Clean up old comments.
* Reactivate shuffeling.
* Reset correct limits for star rating and game to be won.
* (Optional) Add option in welcome message to select game size (16, 32)
