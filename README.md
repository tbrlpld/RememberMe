TODO
----
* Look up HTML tags/elements that suite the purpose of the elements best. Currently almost everything is divs. Try using things like header, nav, main, etc.
* Create functions to build the DOM in the way that it is needed. HTML should not have more than body.
* Add card animations for flipping the card, rejecting and accepting the pair and all cards matched (maybe a delay for congratulations necessary).
* Apply responsive design practices to game. Start developing from small screen size and then go up.
* Make restart button be only text icon (remove border etc.).
* Also, restart button needs to be vertically centered in header (more apparent on bigger screen).
* Make hover shadow of cards smaller.
* Create proper nice looking layout. Especially welcome and congratulations message.
* Make sure layout looks good on all screen sizes/devices. This is also important for the font sizes.
* Update colors, especially of game area and header.
* Add title to header.
* Add animations for welcome screen, transition to game view, build of game, build of card deck, destruction of card deck, destruction of game, transition to congratulations message, congratulations message itself.
* Reset correct limits for star rating and game to be won.
* (Optional) Add option in welcome message to select game size (16, 32)
