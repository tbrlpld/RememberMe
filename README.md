TODO
----
* Center footer text properly. Especially at small width.
* Create functions to build the DOM in the way that it is needed. ~~HTML should not have more than body.~~ HTML should contain the welcome screen to make it searchable by webcrawlers. The game can be build by js.
* Add card animations for flipping the card, rejecting and accepting the pair and all cards matched (maybe a delay for congratulations if necessary).
* Make sure layout looks good on all screen sizes/devices. Game area is already redesigned. Welcome and congratulations should also be reponsive.
* Update colors, especially of game area and header.
* Add animations for welcome screen, transition to game view, build of game, build of card deck, destruction of card deck, destruction of game, transition to congratulations message, congratulations message itself.
* Clean up old comments.
* Reset correct limits for star rating and game to be won.
* (Optional) Add option in welcome message to select game size (16, 32)
