TODO
----
* The footer is now closer to the game but probably a bit too close. Could be a bit further away.
* Remove the 'Back' text from the cards.
* Update colors, especially of game area and header.
* Clean up old comments.
* Make sure every function is at least called once. Remove unneeded functions.
* Check HTML and CSS in code validators.
* Reactivate shuffeling.
* Reset correct limits for star rating and game to be won.
* (Optional) Add option in welcome message to select game size (16, 32)
* Prevent DOM maipulation for matching cards. Currently the matched class could be added to any card in the DOM. I have to think about this a little more. But, what I now realize is that the symbols are visible in the DOM.Not sure if I have to take cre of things like that to pass the class. It is not in the rubric.
